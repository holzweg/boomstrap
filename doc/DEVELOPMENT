Some quickstart guides for development:

* Create only the files you need to override from the base layout, do not copy over files
  which don't need changes (upgrade path and compatibilty)

* Do not edit the original bootstrap files, but override the variables when needed (upgrade path)

* Follow coding and naming standards (Magento, Bootstrap) to get a consistent result
  * No tabs, just spaces
  * UTF-8

* Include the comment block header (copyright holzweg etc.) in every file you create

* Write meaningful commit messages and keep commits small (commit = 1 feature change, not a bunch of changes over a time period)
  * E.g. "changed magento flash messages to match bootstrap markup", "catalog grid uses bootstrap grid system"
